# Preprocessing Unstructured Data for LLM Applications

This repository accompanies the course **[Preprocessing Unstructured Data for LLM Applications](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/preprocessing-unstructured-data-for-llm-applications/)**, created by **[DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)** in collaboration with **[Unstructured](https://unstructured.io/)**.

The course teaches how to transform messy, real-world documents into **structured, high-quality datasets** that can be effectively used for **LLM-powered applications** such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), chatbots, and knowledge assistants.

## üîë Course Topics and Detailed Explanations

### 1. Overview of LLM Data Preprocessing

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but rely heavily on **high-quality input data**. Real-world data ‚Äî PDFs, images, HTML pages, Word docs ‚Äî often comes in messy, unstructured formats.
Key concepts:

* **Unstructured Data**: Free-form data (text, images, tables, scanned docs) that lacks a consistent schema.
* **Why Preprocessing Matters**:

  * Removes noise and inconsistencies.
  * Ensures inputs are machine-readable.
  * Preserves context and meaning for better model performance.
* **LLM Applications That Rely on Clean Data**:

  * Question-answering bots.
  * Document summarizers.
  * Knowledge retrieval systems.
  * Enterprise RAG pipelines.

In essence, preprocessing bridges the gap between raw, messy inputs and **LLM-ready structured data**.

### 2. Normalizing the Content

Unstructured text often has inconsistencies ‚Äî multiple encodings, extra whitespace, broken Unicode characters, or mismatched formats.
Normalization ensures **consistency across documents** before further processing.

Key techniques:

* **Encoding Fixes**: Converting everything to UTF-8 for uniformity.
* **Cleaning Noise**: Removing escape sequences, non-printable characters, or OCR errors.
* **Standardizing Case & Whitespace**: Useful for uniform tokenization.
* **Removing Boilerplate**: Headers, footers, and irrelevant text (common in PDFs/HTML).

Outcome: A **normalized, uniform text representation** that makes downstream processing (like chunking or metadata tagging) reliable.

### 3. Metadata Extraction and Chunking

LLMs perform poorly if fed entire large documents. Instead, we split documents into **semantically meaningful chunks** and attach **metadata** for context.

* **Metadata Extraction**: Captures document attributes.

  * Examples: title, author, date, source URL, section headers, file type.
  * Benefits: Helps filtering and ranking results during retrieval.
* **Chunking**: Dividing text into smaller, meaningful units.

  * Naive chunking: Fixed-length windows (e.g., 500 tokens).
  * Semantic chunking: Splits aligned with natural boundaries (paragraphs, sections).
  * Hybrid approaches: Combine token-based and semantic splitting.
* **Why Chunking Matters**:

  * Prevents LLM context overflow.
  * Improves retrieval granularity.
  * Enhances accuracy of answers in RAG systems.

### 4. Preprocessing PDFs and Images

Real-world documents are often **PDFs (text-based or scanned)** and **images** (screenshots, scanned contracts, receipts). Extracting information from them requires specialized tools.

* **Text-based PDFs**: Direct parsing with libraries (e.g., `pdfminer`, `PyPDF2`, `unstructured`).
* **Scanned PDFs & Images**: Require **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** with tools like `Tesseract` or `Azure OCR`.
* **Challenges**:

  * Misaligned text flow.
  * Columns/tables embedded as images.
  * Poor-quality scans.
* **Best Practices**:

  * Detect document type before processing.
  * Use hybrid extraction (text + OCR).
  * Validate extracted content with metadata checks.

### 5. Extracting Tables

Tables often contain critical structured information (financial statements, experiment results, product catalogs). But they‚Äôre notoriously hard to parse correctly.

* **Challenges in Table Extraction**:

  * Inconsistent layouts.
  * Nested headers.
  * Scanned vs. digital tables.
* **Extraction Techniques**:

  * Rule-based parsing with `pandas.read_html` or `camelot` (for PDFs).
  * OCR + table detection models (for images/scans).
  * Using `unstructured` to preserve table boundaries.
* **Preserving Semantics**: Store tables as structured JSON or DataFrames rather than plain text, so LLMs can understand relationships between rows/columns.

### 6. Building Your Own RAG Bot

The final project brings everything together: **turning unstructured documents into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot**.

Pipeline overview:

1. **Ingestion & Preprocessing**

   * Normalize, clean, and extract text + metadata.
   * Split into chunks.
   * Handle PDFs, images, and tables as needed.
2. **Embedding & Indexing**

   * Convert chunks into embeddings using models like OpenAI‚Äôs `text-embedding-ada-002` or local alternatives.
   * Store embeddings in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS).
3. **Retrieval**

   * Query user input against the vector store.
   * Retrieve the most relevant chunks.
4. **LLM Response Generation**

   * Feed retrieved context + user query into an LLM.
   * Generate a context-aware response.

By the end, learners can build a **production-ready RAG system** that makes unstructured documents queryable through natural language.
